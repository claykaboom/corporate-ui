          <h2>Poke a fellow developer</h2>
          <p>Primary, and probably the best support, should be given by your colleagues around the company. To simplify the communication, we've set up a Slack room for all of us to mingle in.</p>
          <p>So, log in to <a href="https://corporate-ui.slack.com/">https://corporate-ui.slack.com</a> and hopefully there will be someone there to help you out. In other cases, please contact the Corporate UI support group.</p>
          <p>Haven't signed up to Slack yet? Do it here: <a href="https://corporate-ui.slack.com/signup">https://corporate-ui.slack.com/signup</a></p>
          <h2>Corporate UI Support</h2>
          <p>The Corporate UI is partly developed and maintained by IXCD Presentation and Interaction at Scania IT. We have a lot of stakeholders around the Volkswagen Group as we build our components not to work only for Scania, but also for our sister companies.</p>
          <p>We need to listen closely to both our end users and the projects using our technology so please do not hesitate to contact us. Our services ranges from user research, introductory workshops and expert reviews to the planning and implementation of new components. We're available at <a href="mailto:corporate-ui@scania.com">corporate-ui@scania.com</a>.</p>
